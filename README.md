- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Phillip. I'm a student studying computer science at the University of Missouri.

- I have experience as a software development intern at Veterans United Home Loans, the #1 VA mortage provider in the United States. I'm looking for more experience, 
- though, especially industry experience for Summer 2023.
